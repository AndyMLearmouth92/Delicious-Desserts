# Delicious Desserts

Delicious Desserts is a custom-designed and responsive site that I built for a north east desserts parlour. The parlour needed a modern web presence to improve their online reach. The client asked for a sleek and modern look using their branding colours of white, purple and slate alongside using large images to showcase their cakes.

You can view the site live <a href="https://deliciousdessertsjesmond.netlify.app/">here</a>.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on creating a modern and professional site according to my client's specifications.

# Optimisations:
+ I would integrate with the client's social media to include customer reviews.
+ I would integrate a payment system for purchasing cakes online.

# Lessons Learned:
+ Media queries to make the site look great across all devices.
+ Embedding the location from Google Maps.
